# Decision Log

This file records architectural and implementation decisions using a list format.
2025-08-25 07:59:10 - Log of updates made.

*

## Decision

* Adopt a local-first architecture using Next.js 14 App Router with browser localStorage for persistence for the App Studio platform.

## Rationale 

* Ensures zero external dependencies and offline operation (core PRD principle).
* Leverages a familiar React/TypeScript ecosystem for rapid iteration and tool integration.
* Aligns with a modular project structure that supports scalable tool registration and routing.
* Minimizes operational complexity while maximizing speed to value.

## Implementation Details

* Frontend: Next.js 14+ (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React.
* State: React Context + local component state.
* Persistence: localStorage (keys: app-studio-tools, app-studio-preferences, app-studio-usage, tool-${toolId}-data).
* Project Structure:
  - app/page.tsx (dashboard), app/tools/[toolId]/ (tool routes)
  - components/{studio,tools,shared}
  - lib/{storage,tool-registry,types}
  - data/tools
* Data Models: Tool interface, ToolCategory enum, UserPreferences interface with version-aware migration strategy.

  - Create baseline app structure: [src/app/layout.tsx](src/app/layout.tsx), [src/app/globals.css](src/app/globals.css), [src/app/page.tsx](src/app/page.tsx)
  - Configure project: [package.json](package.json), [tsconfig.json](tsconfig.json), [next.config.mjs](next.config.mjs), [postcss.config.js](postcss.config.js), [tailwind.config.ts](tailwind.config.ts)
  - Registry and storage: [src/lib/storage.ts](src/lib/storage.ts), [src/lib/tool-registry.ts](src/lib/tool-registry.ts), [src/data/tools.ts](src/data/tools.ts) with entry id="markdown-formatter"
  - Tool route: [src/app/tools/markdown-formatter/page.tsx](src/app/tools/markdown-formatter/page.tsx) ("use client")
